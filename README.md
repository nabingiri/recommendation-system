# Recommendation System Using Factorization Model and MapReduce Framework

This project is part of my master's thesis :man_student: where we developed a recommendation system using factorization model and MapReduce framework to predict the rating of an item by a user. The factorization model is trained using stochastic gradient descent and is deployed in Amazon EMR (Amazon Elastic MapReduce) cluster for distributed computing.

The code is organized into two directories: train and predict. Each of the directory contains ``README`` file that describes the files present in them.

* ``train`` : contains program to train the model, further details are in ``README`` file inside the ``train`` directory.
* ``predict`` : contains program to predict the rating using ``MRJob``, further details are in ``README`` file inside the ``predict`` directory.


# Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required packages
3. If you wish to train the model, please follow the instructions in the ``README`` file inside the train directory
4. If you wish to use the trained model for prediction, please follow the instructions in the ``README`` file inside the predict directory

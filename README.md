# Recommendation System
This is a part of my master's thesis :man_student:, where I built a recommendation system that uses factorization model and mapreduce framework to predict the rating for an item by a user. The factorization model is trained using gradient descent and is deployed in AWS EMR cluster for distributed computing.

The files are present in the train and predict folders. For details on what these files do, please look through the README on each folders.
* train : trains the model, further details are in README file inside the train folder.
* predict : predicts the rating, further details are in README file inside the predict folder.
